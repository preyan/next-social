Next Social is a social media app built with Next.js 15, Server Actions, Clerk, Tailwind, and PostgreSQL. This project aims to provide users with a modern and interactive social media experience.

## Overview

Next Social leverages the power of Next.js 15, a popular React framework, to create a fast and efficient server-rendered application. By using Server Actions, the app can handle complex server-side logic and provide seamless user interactions.

Clerk, an authentication and user management service, is integrated into Next Social to handle user registration, login, and session management. This ensures a secure and reliable authentication system for the app.

Tailwind CSS is used for styling the user interface of Next Social. With its utility-first approach, Tailwind allows for easy customization and consistency throughout the app's design.

Next Social utilizes PostgreSQL as its database management system. This robust and scalable database ensures efficient data storage and retrieval, enabling the app to handle large amounts of user-generated content.
